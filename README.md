This repository contains the lab assignments for the **Artificial Intelligence Techniques (AIT)** course, part of the Third Year (TY) curriculum. The coursework is guided by **Ms. Snehal Mangale**.

The labs focus on implementing and understanding fundamental AI concepts, including various search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and game theory. All implementations are done in Python within Jupyter Notebooks.

## ðŸ“š Lab Assignments

This repository is organized by lab, with each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file corresponding to a specific topic.

| Lab No. | Topic                                       | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab 1   | **Uninformed Search Algorithms** | Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve classic problems like the **8-Puzzle** and **Maze Navigation**. |
| Lab 2   | **Informed Search Algorithms** | Solving pathfinding problems using the **A\* Search algorithm** with different heuristic functions like Manhattan and Euclidean distance.         |
| Lab 3   | **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)** | Solving the **N-Queens Problem**, **Sudoku Puzzles**, and **Map Coloring** using backtracking combined with the Forward Checking technique.           |
| Lab 4   | **Adversarial Search (Game Theory)** | Building an unbeatable AI for **Tic-Tac-Toe** using the **Minimax algorithm** to explore the game tree and make optimal decisions.                 |
| Lab 5   | **State-Space Search & Classic Problems** | A detailed exploration of state-space search by solving the classic **Water Jug Problem** using both a rule-based simulation and a BFS approach.  |
